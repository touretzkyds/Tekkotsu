  In short, you should put the Tekkotsu directory someplace like
  /usr/local (the default location scripts will look), and then copy
  the template 'project' directory to your personal workspace (like
  your home directory).

  The Tekkotsu directory (the current directory) will be shared by all
  projects.  You should be able to get pretty far without having to
  modify the shared Tekkotsu framework files, although if you do, feel
  free to let us know and send us a patch if you think your changes
  would be useful to others.

  Your code should go in your own copy of the 'project' directory.  To
  build an executable, type 'make' in your local copy of 'project'.
  You should edit project's Environment.conf to choose build settings.
