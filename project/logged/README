This directory holds .png and .pos files to be loaded by the
LoggedData driver when running Tekkotsu in simulator mode on stored
data, which you can do by typing:

  cd ~/project
  ./tekkotsu-<model> -c sim.plist

Files are loaded in alphabetical order.  If you do not want Tekkotsu
to load certain files, move them to the project/logged/reserve
directory (or anywhere other than project/logged).  See the Simulator
chapter of the Tekkotsu tutorial for more information on running in
simulator mode.

Note: another way of providing simulated inputs to Tekkotsu is to run
it using the Mirage virtual environment.  See the Tekkotsu wiki for
instructions on using Mirage.
