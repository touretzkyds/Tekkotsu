This directory can be used to hold logged data (.png and .pos files)
that you do not want Tekkotsu to load right now when running in
simulator mode.

You will typically have several sets of image and posture files from
projects you are working on.  The data can be kept safely out of the
way in this project/logged/reserve directory (or any directory other
than project/logged).  When you want to use specific .png and .pos
files, copy them to project/logged.
