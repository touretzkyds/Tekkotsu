//! abstract base class for simulator data sources
/*! Each subclass will implement loading data from some piece of hardware or network protocol.
 *
 *  The general flow of calls is:
 *  - constructor - user creates an instance of a DeviceDriver (which creates the data source)
 *  - registerSource() - the user selects the data source via SharedGlobals::StreamSimConfig::sources
 *  - enteringRealtime() - if the simulator enters real time mode
 *  - leavingRealtime() - if the simulator is paused, set to full-speed mode, or begins to shut down
 *  - deregisterSource() - simulator is shutting down or otherwise deleting associated DeviceDriver
 *  - destructor - deleting associated DeviceDriver
 *
 *  If your data source provides sensor data for current output values, you should call
 *  providingOutput() for those outputs when registerSource() is called, and ignoringOutput()
 *  when you are no longer active (deregisterSource() or destructor is called).
 *  This prevents the Motion process from clobbering your readings with its own feedback.
