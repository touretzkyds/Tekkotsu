This directory contains behavior-related files.
Subdirectories:
   Controls - Used by the controller for the menu system

      Demos - sample code (note that these are not necessarily 'clean' coding - some are more
              proof of concept at the time they were written and therefore are not always
              the best way to do something.)

      Nodes - For finite state machines, we'll put general purpose nodes here.

   Services - These are behaviors which provide a useful service during execution, not just
              sample code.  For instance, automatic get up, battery monitoring, etc.

Transitions - For finite state machines, we'll put general purpose transitions here.
