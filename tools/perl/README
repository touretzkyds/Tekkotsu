The Tekkotsu/tools/perl directory is a place where you can place
Perl modules if you are unable to install them in the normal
location for your computer because of file permissions.

Currently Tekkotsu requires Parse::RecDescent (used in the
stateparser), which can be downloaded from www.cpan.org.
Simply extract the "Parse" subdirectory and place it in
Tekkotsu/tools/perl.
