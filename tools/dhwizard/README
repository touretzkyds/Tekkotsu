This DH Wizard project was created in Spring 2010 by Owen Greeley and
Nicholas Buroojy, extending an earlier version by Leland Thorpe
(Spring 2009).  All authors are at Carnegie Mellon University.

Documentation describing this project can be found on the Tekkotsu
wiki at wiki.Tekkotsu.org.

To build the tool, cd to the tools/dhwizard/code directory and type "make".

Typical usage:

1. Start the Mirage simulator.

2. Open a kin file (such as Chiara.kin) with this wizard with the
   following command:

   /usr/local/Tekkotsu/tools/DHWizard ~/project/ms/config/Chiara.kin

An optional second argument specifies the host where the Mirage server
is running.  The default is "localhost".
