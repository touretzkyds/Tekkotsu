     -Platform Specific Files-
      -----------------------
      aperios - provides support for Sony AIBO robots (through OPEN-R SDK)
                (includes MMCombo, which forks into Main and Motion processes,
                in addition to Sound and TinyFTPD processes)
      local - provides simulation support for the host platform (UNIX variants),
                as well as communication and device drivers for various hardware.

     -General Source Code-
      -------------------
      Behaviors - Base classes and demo code
      DualCoding - Vision processing package, see http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Tekkotsu/Tutorial/vr-intro.shtml
      Events - Base classes and 'custom' events
      IPC - Inter-Process Communication, mutual exclusion and message passing
      Motion - Most motion related classes
      Planners - Algorithms for planning, e.g. an RRT implementation
      Shared - Utility code
      Sound - Handles mixing and sending sound buffers to system
      Vision - Vision processing code
      Wireless - Networking code

  * Non-Source Framework Files *
    --------------------------
    contrib - additional code which either hasn't been inlined, or the
              original submissions of code that has been imported (thanks!)
    docs - scripts, configuration, and other files for the doxygen documentation
    tools - build scripts, utilities, and PC-side tools.
    deprecated - archaic source, but may still be of some interest
